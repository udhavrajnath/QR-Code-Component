## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

The syntax of using img tags have changed since the last time  I used, so its always good to being able to review and know of the new changes in the language syntax or just in general.
```html
<img src={require('../images/image-qr-code.png')}/>
```

### Useful resources

- [Using google fonts in your projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HyG535JY0) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to import google fonts to your CSS files. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
